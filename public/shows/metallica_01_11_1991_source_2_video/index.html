            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Video quality itself is very good, but the filming is subpar. Shaky recording with quite a few obstructions. Taper almost never zooms in, so the video is somewhat distant despite being filmed from the taper&#39;s section. When he does try to zoom in, the video gets blurry. Audio quality is quite good and enjoyable.
