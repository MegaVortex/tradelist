            This was one of the weirdest show I&#39;ve ever seen. Tim was completely wasted and it looked like Thomas said something &quot;offensive&quot; to Tim on stage. After that Tim smashed his guitar and left the stage. The entire show except &quot;Chapter I: Introverting Dimensions&quot; and &quot;A Single Word&quot; was played by Thomas and Andrew (without Tim). Sound isn&#39;t perfect btw...
