            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Entirely screenshot. Very steady recording with no obstructions. Audio is somewhat distorted and distant. Still a great recording! Filmed with Flip Ultra HD for 2 hours until early Seek &amp; Destroy, then switched with Pinker HD. the sound is terrible on the last song, but the rest is pretty good. Filmed from the back of the stage. there were a rear section that was reserved for family with children under 12 that was more relax with a huge screen.
