	  🚫 Bootlegs are fan-made for trading only - <strong>nothing on this website is for sale or download</strong>!<br>
      🎵 Support the band by buying official releases.<br>
      📭 No more mail trades - it was fun, but that era is over.<br>
	  ☁️ If you contact me first, you'll need to upload first.<br>
      🛒 Browse the site and use the form to request the shows you're interested in - no need to email!<br>
      🙏 Even if we've traded before, I may still ask you to send first. Please respect that.<br>
      ⛔ Shows marked as <strong>NT</strong> are <strong>not available for trade</strong>!<br>
      ⚠️ If you <strong>bad-trade</strong> me, your name will go straight to my Bad Traders list.<br>
