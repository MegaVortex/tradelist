            AMT#1. During the opening noise of &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,&quot; Kurt jammed on the guitar riff of Deep Purple&#39;s &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot;. Kurt stopped &quot;Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam&quot; to yell at a guy groping someone in the audience. The band then picked up the song where they left off. A few bars after resuming the song, Kurt stopped playing guitar and finished singing the song with the guitar lying on his lap.
