            <strong>Note:</strong>
            2nd source. MTV version. Includes backstage footage. Setlist is kind of out of order, as far as the real show is concerned. Since this was apparently filmed by MTV it&#39;s filmed on a tripod, so we have some very steady camerawork. Video looks pretty great, with a little bit of grain. On the unfortunate side here we have some audio problems. When the filmer is on the lower level, the audio is highly distorted! On the upper level, it sounds a lot better but there is a ton of hiss. No matter where this person was filming, just know that it sounds like shit and I hope someone upgrades this one eventually. Kirk smashing his guitar during &quot;Seek And Destroy&quot;.
