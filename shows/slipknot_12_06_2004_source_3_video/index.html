            This video consist of two shows and made as a video-report for some blog probably, includes before the show footage and 5 minutes of supporting band footage. The 1st ange is more complete then the 2nd. 2nd angle consist of small pieces of the songs and it&#39;s pretty shitty, but closer to the stage.
