            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Killer video quality, with FM-SBD Audio! Good zooms and a good camera angle on this one! The original audio on this one was really the show&#39;s downfall. It was heavily distorted and muddy. The replacement audio is from an FM broadcast and is soundboard quality. An obvious improvement.
